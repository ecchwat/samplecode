<p>You go to your neighbor to borrow some milk because you&apos;re out. The next day, when it snows, you bring your snow blower down the hill to help him. When this idea is applied to small business, companies can leverage each other&apos;s strengths at little or no cost to grow both of their businesses. Collaboration through WinWin saves time, saves money, and levels the playing field for American companies. Small business owners can sometimes feel like it&apos;s a dog-eat-dog world out there. If you fall behind, even for a moment, a more tech-savvy business with greater resources could swoop in and take your customers. But competition among businesses doesn&apos;t always have to mean war. Instead of viewing other companies only as competitors, entrepreneur business owners should look at them as potential collaborators. Start by making new alliances now!</p>

<p>Where notifications from other web sites might be considered a nuisance, each WinWin notification represents another business wishing to do some type of business with yours. To put it simply, each notification contains monetary value so in this case, the more notifications, the better. While some of our members still have this misconception and choose to restrict notifications to the bare minimum, keep in mind that each notification is a sign of the exposure generated from the WinWin profile and interaction on the site. Each business decides whether or not to be notified when a user requests an alliance, approves an alliance or comments on a post. A notification can also be sent when a new private message is received or regarding new features and site releases. WinWin&apos;s Notifications can be managed by clicking <em><a href="/account-settings#businessNotifications" target="_blank">Notifications</a></em> in <em><a href="/account-settings" target="_blank">Account Settings</a></em>. Check the notification settings to assure the business is not missing any revenue generating opportunities created on the WinWin platform.

<p>Not enough time to manage this business account? Are there aspects of the account that could be delegated to a different department such as marketing or accounts payable?

Simply click on <em><a href="/account-settings#businessOrganization" target="_blank">Manage Organization</a></em> in <em><a href="/account-settings" target="_blank">Account Settings</a></em> and follow the simple, step by step instructions. A user is an easy and efficient way to maximize the business&apos;s membership on WinWin. For example, a business may want to select department heads to access or post WinWin B2B Exchange items specific to their department&apos;s areas of business responsibility. This is more administratively feasible than creating separate accounts with WinWin. Adding multi users on the business account allows for the ease of distributing tasks and enhancing internal communication and accountability.
