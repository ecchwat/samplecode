					<p>The WinWin industry sponsorship is our flagship advertising platform.
					<br><br>
					With one annual fee, our industry sponsors have an all access pass to
					advertise throughout their industry group. This value is tremendous, with
					great reach, and there are only a few sponsorships to go around!
					<br><br>
					Once a sponsor comes on, they own their WinWin site industry for one
					year.
					<br><br>
					Our unique technology will push sponsor advertisements to targeted
					businesses for optimal results; whether the plan is to target by industry,
					by region or by a different demographic market.
					<br><br>
					Our industry sponsor's logo and brand will be in the forefront of our
					members' minds. It will offer easy access to the sponsor's WinWin profile and
					our sponsors will have unique access to partner with the WinWin team on
					co-op marketing and opportunity spotlights.
					<br><br>

						<p>First of all, thank you for being a long-time WinWin member!
						<br><br>
						In version 1 of our site, members were able to accrue points, which were
						redeemable for a variety of WinWin services/products.
						<br><br>
						We recently updated the site to version 2, and now version 3. In order to facilitate getting
						our much anticipated update online quickly for our members, we decided to
						postpone implementing the rewards feature for a brief time. Accruing
						reward points will be available soon with an intermediate refresh of our
						site.
						<br><br>
						The extra Reward Points were added partly to ease the inconvenience of
						this transition and partly to say "Thank you" to our members who were
						with us since version 1.

					<p>The WinWin map is a feature available to all members to help increase
					visibility on site-wide searches. This is particularly helpful when
					searching for alliances within a certain geographic location, as all members
					are represented as "pushpins" on the map. A Basic Map Profile allows the
					user to select the "pushpin" and view the associated member's basic
					business profile as well as a detailed street view of the actual business
					location. Businesses will also be able to see the surrounding areas and a
					video of the business to show other views that are not shown by the
					street views. This can save businesses and employees tremendous cost in
					meetings, travel and much more.</p>
