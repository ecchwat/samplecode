          <p>Our members control the amount of notifications that are pushed to their e-mails. A member may choose the type of notifications via e-mail that best suits their needs. Some members check their WinWin page regularly and choose no e-mail notifications.
            Other members are unable to view their WinWin page regularly and choose to be notified by e-mail of certain alliance activities.</p>

          <p>To change the notification settings, simply <a href="/account-settings#businessNotifications" target="_blank">click here</a> when logged into the business' WinWin account. From there, select or deselect options that best suit the profile.</p>

          <p>WinWinUSA.com offers much more than a general business to business marketplace. Members have a nearly infinite amount of opportunities to increase revenue, decrease expenses and grow on WinWin. Creativity is the only limitation.</p>

          <p>Although a business's primary objective is to find sales opportunities, members often find much greater tangible value, rewards and opportunities via other avenues.</p>

          <p>For example, cooperative marketing may open doors to reach a larger audience than was feasible without an alliance, or it may open a market previously closed to a business. Members often find expense reduction opportunities through bulk purchases,
            staff sharing, or freight load sharing. There are also opportunities to hold on to valued employees during economic downturns or during seasonal slow-downs.</p>

          <p>As members create and post new ideas in any category, their engagement will prompt additional new ideas and solutions from other members. This business community engagement is what will trigger a revolution of thought in business activity. It
            is this very cycle that launches radical ideas that obliterate existing restrictive paradigms and will catapult the American business landscape into the forefront of the global stage. This is WinWin.</p>

          <p>Those other social media channels address different needs and requirements of businesses and, as such, your business will not realize the same benefits afforded on WinWin. WinWin is the only business-only business social media channel. The others
            are public, individual and consumer-oriented channels. Facebook and Twitter, for example, are consumer platforms used to reach consumers. LinkedIn is also a public channel, but it's purpose is primarily for individuals to network as professionals,
            not as businesses, or for businesses to search employee talent.
          </p>

          <p>WinWin is a secure, U.S. business-only social media channel. This singular, untapped focus is what offers new, previously hidden opportunities to increase revenue, decrease expenses, fill capacity and grow.

          <p>As a new idea, WinWin needs to get the word out, to create a buzz. We use these social media channels for that purpose along with offering a value-add to our members by showcasing select members on our social media channels. Eventually, the
            primary role of these social media channels for WinWin will be aligned with the markets these social media channels serve: consumers and individuals. We will continue using LinkedIn to find top talent, and Facebook and Twitter to help our
            members in the consumer space, while engaging on WinWin for the same benefits and opportunities as all WinWin members: to increase revenue, decrease expenses, fill capacity and grow.</p>

          <p>WinWin will always be an exclusive B2B community, free from the confines of public, consumer oriented social media channels. This alone is a top reason businesses join and are engaged on WinWin.</p>

          <p>The easiest way to get started on WinWin is to <em>complete the
						business profile</em>. Upload a logo, describe your business, list the business's products and services, upload photos, link to videos, etc. The more information about the business, the greater likelihood of discovering a tangible opportunity!</p>

          <p>Next, begin growing the business's <em>alliance network</em>. Request an alliance with any and all businesses that are of interest. Reach outside your industry, too.</p>

          <p>Finally, <em>search posted opportunities</em>. Visit the B2B Exchange, Co-op Marketing and Events pages. See what other members are offering.</p>

          <p>When ready, feel free to post new B2B Exchange or Co-Op Marketing opportunities, or a business event on the Events page.</p>

          <p><em>Tip: Share business thoughts on the Business Wisdom page, under the MORE menu item.</em>
